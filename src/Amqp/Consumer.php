/**
 * php-amqplib blocking consume loop with HMAC verify-before-handler
 * (CONTRACT.md §8, D-04).
 *
 * This is NOT a web-request path — `consume()` blocks on `$channel->wait()`
 * for the lifetime of the process. It is meant to run on a long-running
 * runtime (a dedicated CLI worker process), restarted by a process
 * supervisor on exit (see bin/axiam-amqp-worker.php — no in-SDK
 * auto-reconnect loop, Pitfall 6).
 *
 * Ack/nack semantics (verifyAndDispatch):
 *   - HMAC verification failure           -> nack WITHOUT requeue (fail closed, poison-loop risk)
 *   - NEW-4 replay-protection gate failure -> nack WITHOUT requeue (fail closed, same as HMAC failure)
 *   - Handler throws AmqpDropMessage       -> nack WITHOUT requeue (application-declared poison message)
 *   - Handler throws any other \Throwable  -> nack WITH requeue (transient failure, retry)
 *   - Handler completes successfully       -> ack
 *
 * NEW-4 (CONTRACT.md §8 "v2 — Replay Protection", hard cutover): once the
 * HMAC verifies, the delivery is ADDITIONALLY rejected (same nack-without-
 * requeue path) when `key_version < 2`, `issued_at` falls outside the
 * ±skew freshness window, or `nonce` has already been seen. Because
 * Hmac::verify re-serializes the decoded body (minus `hmac_signature`) in
 * insertion order (Pitfall 5), `nonce`/`issued_at` are already covered by
 * the verified HMAC bytes with NO canonicalization change — only the
 * {@see ReplayGuard} gates are new. See ReplayGuard for the full policy.
